Why I built myself a share CLI tracker?
<!--more-->

## Here is why

I was tired of checking my account regularly to see how stocks were doing. Yes, I know, invest passively and don't check. But I'm too curious about that. I don't sell my shares, I rarely buy more, actually always according to my plan anyway, but I still keep checking. Simply because I'm interested in how things are looking at the moment.

But I don't want to log in to Trade Republic or comdirect all the time to see what the situation is. But I would just like to have a little graph and see what the price is at the moment. So I just built this.

Here you can see how.

## Getting Started

First, I looked for simple APIs that show me the price of an ETF. Many recommended yahoo finance, some google. But I did not find a simple and free API. Only [this](https://github.com/darthbatman/yahoo-stock-prices) Nodejs package, which is written in JavaScript. Here it seemed easier to me to just quickly rewrite the code in TypeScript than to type the library.

## Code

No sooner said than done. So I copied the two functions I need and typed them:

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';
import { HistoricalPrice, StockPrice } from '../models';

const BASE_URL = 'https://finance.yahoo.com';

const getCurrentData = (ticker: string): Promise<StockPrice> => {
  return axios
    .get<String>(`${BASE_URL}/quote/${ticker}/`)
    .then((data) => {
      const content = data.data;
      let startPosition = content.indexOf(`"${ticker}":{"sourceInterval"`) + `"${ticker}":`.length;
      let index = startPosition;
      let bracketsCounter = 0;
      for (let i = index; i < content.length; i++) {
        if (content[i] === '{') {
          bracketsCounter++;
        }
        if (content[i] === '}') {
          bracketsCounter--;
        }
        if (bracketsCounter === 0) {
          index = i;
          break;
        }
      }
      try {
        const result: StockPrice = JSON.parse(
          content.substr(startPosition, index - startPosition + 1)
        );
        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        return Promise.reject(`Could not parse data for ${ticker}`);
      }
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      return Promise.reject(`Could not load data for ${ticker}`);
    });
};
```

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/auryn31/terminal-stocks-observer/blob/main/src/yahoo/index.ts). I typed the second function, but I don't need it.

The next step was to show the whole thing as a table and as a graph in the terminal. For the table I used [cli-table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-table), for the graph [asciichart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciichart). I am very satisfied with the result, even though the code can certainly be simplified and improved.

I always start it with the following command `yarn dev -c config.csv -t 600 -l sum.csv`.

The config looks like this:

```csv
AAPL,15
GOOG,3
URTH,17
EEM,6
```

The first column is the code you find on [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and the second column is the number.

The code on finance is the one in brackets after the company name:

## Conclusion

I hope the [tool](https://github.com/auryn31/terminal-stocks-observer) helps you to track your shares. But as [Gerd Kommer](https://www.gerd-kommer-invest.de/buecher/#simie) says in the book *Souver√§n investieren mit Indexfonds und ETFs*, set up a plan and stick to it. So don't let the tool lead you into gambling.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/auryn31/terminal-stocks-observer) as usual.
