Here are my resons to switch from Medium to my own custom blog.

<!--more-->

I have posted my contributions on various sites over the last few years. On [medium](https://medium.com/@aengel), dev.to and internal company blogs. What always bothered me was that I was bound to their system and requirements. On medium it was difficult to insert code, on internal blogs you always had to go through a review process.

I was always quite happy with medium (except that I couldn't write in markdown), but now that they've changed their models and charge people for articles, it was a no-go for me. I post to give back to the community, not for money or the likes. The goal is to have a knowledge base that helps me and others.

In the end, I couldn't achieve that with medium. So I had to create my own blog.

My requirements for the blog were that it should be fast, static and responsive. I also wanted to be able to easily publish new posts and version everything. So jekyll and hugo came into question.

After a little research, I decided to go with Hugo because it renders super fast and the system is simple (I also like go ðŸ¤ª).

So, long story short, here is my new blog. I'm now transferring my old posts bit by bit and will only post new ones here.

Maybe there will be a newsletter at some point. But that's not priority 1.

If you have any suggestions or changes, feel free to write me on [github](https://github.com/auryn31) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/auryn-engel/).

I look forward to hearing from you ðŸ¤™.
