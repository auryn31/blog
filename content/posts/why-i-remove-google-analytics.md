I just removed Google Analytics from my blog post. Since it is not clear if it's still allowed in Germany, I just go the easy way and remove it. I mean, since I asked the user if he allows Google Analytics on my blog, I got no info at all from them ðŸ˜…. So it's way easier to just remove it.

Here you can read further information.

- [Is Google Analytics ILLEGAL in your country?](https://isgoogleanalyticsillegal.com/)
- [Google Analytics declared illegal in the EU.](https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/google-analytics/)

It would be pretty interesting to see which blog posts are read most, where the user comes from, and so on. So it was interesting to see. On medium, I saw a lot of these statistics. But in the end, I don't do it to get sued or collect user data. I just want to give the community something back since I read a lot of blog posts from others and get a lot of information from posts.

So let's continue without Google ðŸ˜Ž.
