Hello, welcome to my blog.

I'm Auryn Engel. Full stack developer at SAP. Here I publish a few things that I work on in my spare time, what I find exciting and just know what I like to share.

I probably also put some templates here that I need every now and then and don't feel like googling every time.

Maybe it will help one or the other.

If you want to improve something in the article or just get in touch with me, feel free to use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/auryn-engel/) or [Github](https://github.com/auryn31).

Otherwise, thank you for being here ðŸ˜€.
